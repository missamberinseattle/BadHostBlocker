	I replaced the front suspension parts: struts, upper and lower control arms, lower ball joint, The dead instrument cluster may be the reason your getting the P0500 code in the ECM.
	
	The vehicle speed input for the ECM comes from the instrument cluster. The cluster sends a signal out to the ECM for vehicle speed information. The vehicle speed sensor is wired to the instrument cluster.
	
	You need to figure out why the insturment cluster is dead. You should check power and grounds to the cluster first. Then check to make sure it is getting the correct inputs. You'll need a wiring schematic and volt meter to make your checks at the cluster connectors.

	are a good portion of the types of players you get in testing. Pigeonled into a segmented color or tught process for testing, forever unable to branch out of the basics. "Dude, I have this bomb as squirrel deck" "You suld check out this blue deck I've got" "Man, my Maze of Ith deck wrecked sp years ago" As a former play tester myself (Legend of the Five Rings), I worked on some broke decks in testing to sw w disconnected the designers were. My group put out several turn 3 or 4 decks that were reliable & could combo out several ways. My group helped get cards errata'd, dropped from production or changed (even reprints of older cards included in new sets) before going to print. I don't know that HS has that same quality of group doing this, especially since it's such a new game. Just FYI, most or all of the Hearthstone card designers are excellent at the game, and one of them hit NA Legendary #1 for a period of time in December: I think 

	the vaporized residue will get stuck in the air conditioning vents and will stay sticky and attract dirt. I will try to get in touch with him to see what the worst offenders are, but it's not an unreasonable concern. That reminds of fixing PCs wse owner's smoke a lot. Gross. I wouldn't think so. The amount of wax that burns is so minimal it suldn't matter. You can also use cotton balls and petroleum jelly (Vaseline). This will burn rain or dry for about 2 minutes. That's what I do for backpacking, much more compact and they take a spark from a fire starter better than what these would. Just stuff an old small plastic jar with cotton balls smothered in petroleum jelly and use one per fire. I use a big dollar store bottle of hand sanitizer. 

	is an awesome theory and totally seems likely given the sw's attention to detail. It amazes me w well it extends from the original Death Billiards; I find myself very impressed with it so far. Regarding the Chawot book: it's worth noting that at the very end of the intro the new girl is lding dolls in her hands that represent the guy and girl from the book's cover. I'm guessing Nona's perspective stems from one core misconception that is central to her understanding of the book (and by extension, humans), which the new girl will topple over the course of the sw. It's telling that Nona believed the couple wouldn't find happiness because the man was 'incapable of trusting others' -- we don't know whether his marriage would've led him to learn to trust, but she umes it's impossible. There's 2 reasons why
